## General info
This project was the first survey page I have created from FreeCodeCamp assignments. I own an Cannabis travel accessories E-Commerce business and I decided to used this opportunity to create a survey to find out Canadians' habits of cannabis consumption.
	
## Languages
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS

 
# Website Info

* Complete the survey for a chance to win prizes!
